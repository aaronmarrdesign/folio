I've always been a huge fan of WordPress. It is a great platform for your average Joe wanting to set up a small business Website. There are vast amounts of professional grade themes and plugins that work and look great straight out of the box.

However, recently I've found WordPress to be a bit bloated for my particular needs. I want to create a clean and simple blog platform free from clutter so that I can orgainse and present my thoughts and ideas in a clean way. I know this can be done in terms of WordPress themeing, but in terms of the software itself there are many features that I will not use, nor have I ever used before.

## A new way of creating Websites

Recently some of the cooler kids around the internet have been talking about this concept of running statically generated Websites. This method of building Websites can greatly cut down on server load, improving performance, and is much more simplistic from a development point of view. I won't go into a rundown of each of the available platforms but the most appealing to me was running Jekyll via GitHub pages. 

It is possible to run Jekyll via GitHub, meaning you can easily set up a Website running on a rock-solid framework, and better still its free, meaning no hosting charges! As an added bonus, there is an awesome interface to GitHub, prose.io, that is super minimal and really fits in with my vision of the clean and minimal. I thought I would give it a try

So far, especially after the initial hiccups of getting the site up and running (thanks Oliver!), I'm really enjoying using Jekyll. From a developer point of view, there really isn't a more simple way to build and manage Websites than using Jekyll on GibHub. The Jekyll templates are tiny, and everything is managed through GitHub which gives an instant feeling of peace of mind somehow. I'm still not sure how Jekyll via GitHub would fare from a client perspective, but from a developers point of view I can say that its awesome.
