title: The Design Process
abstract: The design process typically envolves five stages. The brief is used as the central document initiated by the client and developed by the creative team and includes details such as a problem statement, technical requirements and a common vision or set of goals for the creative team. Next a period of research begins to uncover insights that help during the design phase.The design phase is the formulation of a design direction and typically envolves visual styling and coming up with the technical scoping. Next, the amends phase is a process of going back to the client, making amends to the design (and sometimes the brief if necessary, which in turn would require a further period of research) and then making an agreement that the design direction is adequate before moving on into production. Finally the production phase is where the product gets built. This may initially involve prototyping before upscaling to a full working model. If the project is taking an iterative approach, at the end of the production stage there may be testing and user feedback, before beginning the whole process again.

## The Brief

The traditional brief comprises of a set of four documents that are use to guide a project during its initial stages. The client brief, the creative brief , the technical brief and the idea brief all need to be defined by the creative team, in consultation with the client, in order for a project to proceed in the corect way.

#### The Client Brief

The client brief is usually the first document that initializes a project. The purpose of this document is to outline and initial problem that needs to be solved, and is used to share a common vision within the creative team. 

Once the brief has been created it may not be adequate. Often needs to be tweaked in order for it to be effective in its purpose; of outlining the initial problem statement in as much detail as possible, and highlighting the common goals that the creative team should be working towards.

A period of consultation between the creative team and the client may be in order to successfully create the initial client brief.

#### The Creative Brief

The creative brief is a document that is delivered by the creative team as a response to the inial client brief. This document is used as the central document during the creative phase of the project.

The creation of this document may incorperate findings of research – such as user reviews, content audits etc. – and should be created in consultation of the whole creative team after a of ideas sessions, brainstorming and problem solving sessions. 

The creative brief should include a proposal where the project is described in more detail, specifically what needs to be done in order for the goals to be achived.

Details of target audience should be included in the creative brief, informed by research, that outlines any charcteristics or traits that the audience may have. Personas may be use to highlight specific types of users that can help during the design phase of the project.

Once this document is delivered it is used throught the design phase of the project to make sure that the design is on track.
