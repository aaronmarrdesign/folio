#My new blog
For the past couple of weeks I've been thinking about keeping a new blog. Having started a new job I think a blog might be nice to write down thoughts and share my ideas with other people.

I've always been a fan of WordPress. It has an awesome community of designers and developers and its pretty easy to get a decent Website up and running for you average s/m sized business or personal Website. 

Recently tho, I've been lured by the idea of statically generated Websites. Meaning, websites built without the need for a database. This cuts down a lot of the overheads necessary for generating content dynamically using databases and php. What you end up with is a fast, slimmed down Website that doesn't require a database or any complex software in order to generate dynamic content.

Whilst there are a few decent ways of doing this (I won't go in to reviewing all of those, for the time being) the one that caught my attention was Jekyll running on Github Pages. To be completely honest with you I went with github because it is free. But Github is awesome software in its own right. Its reliable and fast. The other bonus with running Jekyll on GitHub is the beautifull prose.io interface for compiling posts (actually its a proper interface to Github in general, but it works nicely as a simplistic blogging platform too). The other huge appeal with creating Websites in this way is that the code base is tiny. One of the not-so-great things about WordPress is theme files can quickly become bloated, so tiny Websites is fine by me.
