I am developing a blog using Jeykll and it would be super useful to have support for post types, such as: text, photo, video, etc.

Each post type would have its own settings and requirements. For instance, the text type might require a title and permalink, the photo type might not require a title or permalink. Posts would appear in the main list, but only those with permalinks would be statically produced as individual posts.

I know this might not be viable for this repo but maybe a plugin. I would hack it together myself but I know very little Ruby...
