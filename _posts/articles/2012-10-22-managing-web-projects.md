abstract: For the past couple of months I've been looking for the perfect platform to run my personal blog. With every new project I like to step back and take a look around to find the best way forward.

Iterative devlelopment means you don't have to get everything perfect straight away. You can fine tune features over time. It is difficult to iterate the foundations on which the app is based. It is possible possible to change the foundations but not without significant cost which may affect the viablility of the project.

An Iterative process relies on our ability to successfully focus on something for a short period of time, and takes into account our inability to accurately predict how theory becomes reality. By taking short, iterative steps, we can focus on creating brilliance one move at a time, and can evlove our app as we get a better feel for the features that succeed and those that don't turn out as we hoped.

* Reducing the timescale of a project always affects the quality or scope. 
* Spending less money on a project typically results in removing features from the scope rather than spending less time. Even with a reduced scope, a project usually still stretches to fill the original timescale.
* An increase in desired quality almost always demands an increase in timescale or cost, rather than a reduced scope.

#### Phase Development.

Rarely does a web app require all of the planned features to launch. Instaed, only those that produce the minimum viable product are necessary in the first phase. Postpone non-essential features until a later phase of development.
